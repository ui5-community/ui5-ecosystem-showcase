# UI5 bookshop application using custom UI5 CLI extensions

This sample application shows the consumption of the custom UI5 CLI extensions.

Peek at both [`ui5.yaml`](ui5.yaml) and [`package.json`](package.json) in order to learn about the UI5 CLI configuration and its' `npm` package dependencies and configuration options.

> :warning: The sample here is using a `JSONModel` to load the CAP data. This should be changed to `ODataModel`!
