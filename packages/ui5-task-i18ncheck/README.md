Task for [ui5-builder](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-builder), checking missing translations.

## Prerequisites

- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: "3.0"`](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))

> :warning: **UI5 Tooling Compatibility**
> All releases of this tooling extension using the major version `3` require UI5 Tooling V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 Tooling. But the usage of the latest UI5 Tooling is strongly recommended!

## Install

```bash
npm install ui5-task-i18ncheck --save-dev
```

## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)

- debug: true|false  
Verbose logging

## Usage

1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:

```json
"devDependencies": {
    // ...
    "ui5-task-i18ncheck": "*"
    // ...
}
```

2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:

```yaml
builder:
  customTasks:
  - name: ui5-task-i18ncheck
    afterTask: replaceVersion
    configuration:
      debug: true
```

## How it works

The task reads all XML views and i18n properties files. Then the task cross-checks for missing translations and gives a warning if it can catch one. Currently, views created in javascript is not included in the check.
