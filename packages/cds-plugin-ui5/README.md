# cds-plugin-ui5

The `cds-plugin-ui5` is a CAP server `cds-plugin` which enables the integration of UI5 tooling based (UI5 freestyle or Fiori elements) projects into the CAP server via the UI5 tooling express middlewares. The UI5 or Fiori elements projects just need to be located in the `app` folder of the CAP server or be dependency of the CAP server.
