# UI5 middleware to serve a locally built UI5 framework version

> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.

Middleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), delivering the UI5 framework from a locally built version. The first time a UI5 version is being used (derived from the framework configuration of the project), it will be built and locally stored in the `~/.ui5/ui5-middleware-serveframework` folder per version. For any follow-up usage of the version, it will be served from the local folder. Benefits are the usage of the preload files and pure static file access.

## Prerequisites

- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: "3.0"`](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))

> :warning: **UI5 Tooling Compatibility**
> All releases of this tooling extension using the major version `3` require UI5 Tooling V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 Tooling. But the usage of the latest UI5 Tooling is strongly recommended!

## Install

```bash
npm install ui5-middleware-serveframework --save-dev
```

## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)

- `debug`: *`boolean`*, default: `false`
- `ui5VersionEnvVariable`: *`string`*
  Name of environment variable that contains ui5 version (in case you want to override framework version from ui5.yaml)
- `envFilePath`: *`string`*, default: `./.env`
  Path to file with environment variables
- `strictSSL`: `boolean`
  Ignore strict SSL checks. Default value `true`.
- `saveLibsLocal`: `boolean`, default: `false`
  When enabled, libraries are saved in the project directory (.ui5-middleware-serveframework) instead of the user home directory. While this isolates the libraries per project, it requires additional disk space and compilation time compared to sharing compiled libraries across projects.
- `cachePath`: `string`
  Custom path to store cached framework files. By default, files are stored in the user home directory (~/.ui5/ui5-middleware-serveframework) or project directory depending on saveLibsLocal setting.

## Usage

1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:

```json
"devDependencies": {
    // ...
    "ui5-middleware-serveframework": "*"
    // ...
}
```

2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  customMiddleware:
  - name: ui5-middleware-serveframework
    afterMiddleware: compression
    configuration:
      ui5VersionEnvVariable: UI5_VERSION
      envFilePath: "./.dev.env"
```

## How it works

The middleware looks-up the UI5 framework version in the `ui5.yaml` and then first builds the framework with all libraries locally and serves the content of those libraries from there.
