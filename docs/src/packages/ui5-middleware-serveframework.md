# UI5 middleware to serve a locally built UI5 framework version

> :wave: This is a **community project** and there is no official support for this package! Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.

Middleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), delivering the UI5 framework from a locally built version. The first time a UI5 version is being used (derived from the framework configuration of the project), it will be built and locally stored in the `~/.ui5/ui5-middleware-serveframework` folder per version. For any follow-up usage of the version, it will be served from the local folder. Benefits are the usage of the preload files and pure static file access.

## Prerequisites

- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: "3.0"`](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))

> :warning: **UI5 Tooling Compatibility**
> All releases of this tooling extension using the major version `3` require UI5 Tooling V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 Tooling. But the usage of the latest UI5 Tooling is strongly recommended!

## Install

```bash
npm install ui5-middleware-serveframework --save-dev
```

## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)

- `debug`: *`boolean`*, default: `false`

## Usage

1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:

```json
"devDependencies": {
    // ...
    "ui5-middleware-serveframework": "*"
    // ...
}
```

2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  customMiddleware:
  - name: ui5-middleware-serveframework
    afterMiddleware: compression
```

## How it works

The middleware looks-up the UI5 framework version in the `ui5.yaml` and then first builds the framework with all libraries locally and serves the content of those libraries from there.
