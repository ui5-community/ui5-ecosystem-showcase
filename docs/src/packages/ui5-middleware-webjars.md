# UI5 middleware for delivering content from JAR files

Middleware for [ui5-server](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-server), delivering the content of JAR files.

## Prerequisites

- Requires at least [`@ui5/cli@3.0.0`](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/v3/pages/CLI/) (to support [`specVersion: "3.0"`](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/Configuration/#specification-version-30))

> :warning: **UI5 Tooling Compatibility**
> All releases of this tooling extension using the major version `3` require UI5 Tooling V3. Any previous releases below major version `3` (if available) also support older versions of the UI5 Tooling. But the usage of the latest UI5 Tooling is strongly recommended!

## Install

```bash
npm install ui5-middleware-webjars --save-dev
```

## Configuration options (in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`)

- classpathFile: `string`

  the file containing the classpath (list of files, separated with the path delimiter) which can be created via:

  > `mvn clean dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.cpFile=target/classpath`

- rootPath: `string`

  the root path to the static resources on your system

- jarRootPath: `string`, default: `META-INF/resources/`

  the root path in the JAR file containing the static resources

- debug: `boolean`, default: `false`

## Usage

1. Define the dependency in `$yourapp/package.json`:

```json
"devDependencies": {
    // ...
    "ui5-middleware-webjars": "*"
    // ...
}
```

2. configure it in `$yourapp/ui5.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  customMiddleware:
  - name: ui5-middleware-webjars
    afterMiddleware: compression
    configuration:
      rootPath: "jars"
      jarRootPath: "META-INF/"
```

## How it works

The middleware searches for JAR files in the `rootPath`, loads them and serves the content from JAR files following the web static resources concept of Servlet 3.0 (WebJARs). By default, this allows to consume static resources from the JAR files from within the `META-INF/resources/` path. When using JAR files following a derived web static resources concept it is possible to override the JAR root path with the configuration `jarRootPath`.

```text
jarRootPath: "META-INF/resources/"

META-INF/resources/my/resource/path/Resource.js => http://localhost:8080/my/resource/path/Resource.js

---
jarRootPath: "META-INF/"

META-INF/resources/my/resource/path/Resource.js => http://localhost:8080/resources/my/resource/path/Resource.js
```
